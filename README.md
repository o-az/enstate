## 🚀 Getting Started

We believe software should be simple and containerized. Enstate provides you with a lightweight docker container that you can run anywhere.

docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://0.0.0.0:6379 \
  -e RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth \
  ghcr.io/v3xlabs/enstate:0.0.1
```

### 🐳 Docker Compose
